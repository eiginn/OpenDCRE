    """ Base interface for all Devicebus objects supported by OpenDCRE.

    Primarily, this defines some common methods that can be used or overridden
    by its subclasses. Of note, the `_instance_name` member should be used by
    terminal subclasses to specify the name of the device that class represents.

    A `handle` method is also defined and should not be overridden. It provides
    the device logic to process an incoming Command and dispatch it to the Device's
    appropriate handler method, if it exists.

    Finally, a `register` method is defined but not implemented, as device
    registration is dependent on the type of devicebus instance being registered.
